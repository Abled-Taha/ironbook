# Scripts

Automation for building, releasing, installing and developing Project Iron
Book. Everything is driven through a single entry point:

```sh
scripts/ironbook.sh <command>
```

## Commands

| --- | --- |
| `help` | Show available commands |
| `setup` | Run the first-time developer setup |
| `build` | Build the project artifacts |
| `release` | Cut and sign a release |
| `update-version` | Bump version numbers |
| `get-tree` | Print the repository tree |
| `get-codebase` | Dump the codebase (useful for reviews and AI context) |

Run `scripts/ironbook.sh help` for the full, up-to-date list.

## Layout
