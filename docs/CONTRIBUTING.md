# Contributing to ironbook

First off, thank you for considering contributing to **ironbook**! Projects like this rely on community contributions, bug reports, and feedback to stay high quality.

This document outlines the workflow, environment setup, and coding conventions used across the project's polyglot monorepo.

## Code of Conduct

Please keep discussions, issue threads, and pull request reviews respectful, constructive, and helpful. We aim to foster an inclusive environment for developers of all skill levels.

---

## Monorepo Architecture

`ironbook` is structured into isolated layers within a single repository:

* **Backend (`/apps/api` or root Rust crate):** Built with Rust and Axum.
* **Web Frontend (`/apps/web`):** Built with Python and Django.
* **Docs Site (`/apps/home`):** Next.js with TypeScript.
* **Android (`/apps/android`):** Native Android application built with Kotlin.
* **Desktop (`/apps/desktop`):** Built with C# and Avalonia.
* **Database:** PostgreSQL managed via SQLx migrations.

---

## Local Development Setup

Before contributing code, ensure you have the necessary runtime dependencies installed:

* **Mise**
* **Docker & Docker Compose**
* **MinGW-w64-GCC**

---

## Development Workflow

### 1. Find or Create an Issue
Before diving into code, check the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/ironbook-labs/ironbook/issues).
* For existing open issues, leave a quick comment to let others know you are working on it.
* For new features or non-trivial fixes, please **open an issue first** to discuss the proposed changes.

### 2. Branch Naming Conventions
Create a descriptive branch from `main`:

* `feat/short-description` — for new features
* `fix/short-description` — for bug fixes
* `refactor/short-description` — for code cleanups
* `docs/short-description` — for documentation updates

*Example:* `feat/add-user-auth-endpoint`

### 3. Making Changes & Local Verification
Ensure all components you modified pass local compilation, type checks, and formatting rules prior to pushing:

#### Backend (Rust / Axum)
```bash
# Check syntax & types without full build
cargo check

# Run test suite
mise run //apps/api:test-full

# Enforce formatting and linting
# WILL BE DONE AUTOMATICALLY BEFORE COMITTING
```

#### Docs Site (Next.js)
```bash
# Run linter and type-checking (Needs to be automated in future with pre-commit hooks)
pnpm lint
pnpm build
```

#### Mobile App (Kotlin)
```bash
# Build debug APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Run unit tests
./gradlew test
```

### 4. Working with Database & SQLx
If your pull request alters PostgreSQL database schemas or adds/modifies SQL queries using `sqlx`:

1. Create a new migration file:
```bash
sqlx migrate add <migration_name>
```

2. Apply migrations to your local dev database:
```bash
sqlx migrate run
```

3. **Update SQLx Offline Data:** Because CI pipelines compile Rust without a live database connection, compile-time query checks rely on `sqlx-data.json`. Before opening a PR, update the offline data cache:
```bash
cargo sqlx prepare
```
*Commit the generated/updated `sqlx-data.json` along with your schema changes.*

### 5. Submitting a Pull Request
1. Push your branch to GitHub:
```bash
git push origin feat/your-feature-name
```

2. Open a Pull Request against the `main` branch.
3. Fill out the **PR Template** in full:
4. Wait for CI checks to complete and address any reviewer feedback promptly.

## Coding & Commit Standards
- **Commit Messages:** Keep commit messages concise, imperative, and clear:
- **Clean Code:** Write self-documenting code with inline comments where logic is complex or non-obvious. Avoid committing commented-out code or unused debug statements (`println!`, `console.log`).
